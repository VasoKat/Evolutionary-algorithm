# Evolutionary-algorithm
Evolutionary algorithm which simulates a population in Java.
The EA will eliminate the function f(x1,x2) = x1^2 + x2. The 
population has 5 members, two of them are selected,crossover is done and 2
descendants are created. The descendants became mutated and new population 
will be created. This procedure happens for a number of generations chosen by user.
This project was done in collaboration with one fellow student.
